# Characterizing the Dynamics, Reactivity, and Controllability of Moods in Depression with a Kalman Filter

Welcome to this repository. Here, we delve into the psychometric and inferential aspects of integrating ecological momentary assessment (EMA) data with Kalman filtering across real-life scenarios. Furthermore, we apply the Kalman filter to a series of EMA datasets comprising over 700 participants, both with and without symptoms of depression.

## Data
We analyzed three distinct datasets:

- **Dataset 1**: This dataset is not publicly available. For more information, refer to [this link](https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.1312114110).
- **Dataset 2**: This dataset is not publicly available. For more details, see [this publication](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31708010/).
- **Dataset 3**: The raw data can be found in the `data/singledataset` folder and on [OSF](https://osf.io/j4fg8/). Preprocessed data is available in `data/data_prep/singledataset`.

## Analyses
All scripts related to data handling, modeling, and statistical analyses are located in the `code` folder.

## Results
All figures and intermediate files are available in the `results` folder.
